This is a brief documentation of our work until now on PINN.
There are total of 15 files including thin on: 'README.txt':

    (5 files) 'figure_N.png' files: comparison plots of PINN and CFD, 'PINN.png' representation of PINN
    
    PINN: (3 files)
        'PINN-1D_Nozzle.ipynb' is our well commented and well explained Jupyter noteboook object oriented PINN code.
        'NN2.py' python source code only file for the above Jupyter notebook.
         The dataset 'cdnozzle.txt' file for PINN.
         
    Basic-NN: (4 files)
        'Basic-NN_code.ipynb' non-object oriented basic Neural network - well commented and explained
        'Neu_Net1_NOO.py' python source code only file for the above Jupyter notebook.
        'cdnozzle1.txt' and 'cdnozzle_test.txt' as training and testing dataests for the Basic-NN_code.py.
    
    Report: (1 file)
        'Report_ PINN for steady 1D nozzle Problem.ipynb' is documentation of the overall problem and solution approach.
